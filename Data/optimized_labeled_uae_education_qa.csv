In Queensland why was Brisbane s location chosen as opposed to establishing the city where Cairns is As the existence of Cairns shows that towns can be in the north why hasn t it grown to the same size as Brisbane,,"In Queensland, why was Brisbane s location chosen as opposed to establishing the city where Cairns is? As the existence of Cairns shows that towns can be in the north, why hasn t it grown to the same size as Brisbane as a second major city in QLD? In addition to Harry Kriewaldt s answer, there are a couple of other issues that would have made Cairns less attractive than South Queensland. The tyranny of distance was much more real in the days of early settlement, air services being non-existent and the Great Barrier Reef being much more of a barrier to sea traffic until its hazards were charted. The locals in the area were not particularly friendly, as the explorer Leichhardt found to his cost. As well, the rain forests were not the relatively manicured and garden-like features of today. They would have been a major barrier to settlement. I understand the vegetation was far less dense in the south. Other attempts to settle in the north e.g around Port Essington failed for these sorts of reasons, plus tropical diseases. I suspect that the answer to the second question flows from the first. Cairns was not just not the second established town in Queensland, but came rather late in the piece. It has advantages. It is the natural port and main town for the productive and fertile Atherton Tableland to its west. It is in an area of great natural beauty. That has given it great potential for tourism and many entrepreneurs have made the most of this. However it has also proved to be something of a trap. Tourism is the ultimate discretionary expenditure. It depends on fashion, the exchange rate, the rise and fall of economies and currently pandemics.

As the existence of Cairns shows that towns can be in the north, why hasn t it grown to the same size as Brisbane as a second major city in QLD? Former Photographer and Photography Teacher at TAFE NQUpvoted by , lives in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia (2004-present) and Brisbane was settled before there were any European settlements in North Queensland. It should be mentioned here that Queensland did not exist then. Originally the settlement that became Brisbane was initially supposed to be up near where Gladstone is now. It was decided that the site was not suitable so they dropped back to the Brisbane River and settled there. Settlement in parts of the topics (or subtropics) was fraught with problems like disease and, of course the local inhabitants were not very happy to have a bunch of interlopers stuffing up their hunting grounds. All of the East Coast was at that time New South Wales and Sydney was the Administrative centre. Actually Cairns is not the important city in NQ. The major city up there is Townsville. Many people however do not think of Townsville because it is not so reliant upon tourism. Townsville has a large defence base, industrial area, a rail centre for the East coast as well as to the West. The port ships out many tons of mineral products from the mines to the West as well as the products from the Zinc and Copper refineries. The port also has a huge sugar bulk storage and handling facility. Townsville is also the administrative centre for the North. If Queensland was to split at the Tropic of Capricorn (Rockhampton) it would become the capital of Capricornia . Cairns also has a port with storage and handling for sugar, as does Mackay. cairns is very concentrated upon tourism (Mackay also). There are some mineral exports from the hinterland going through the port but nothing like through Townsville. Cairns is also some what restricted in the available area for growth. It is wedged in between the coastal ranges and the sea. When Brisbane was established there was very little know of any of the North and a few explorers who went for a look did not return. Not very conducive for early settlement. Actually, before Cairns was established the earlier settlement was Smithfield on the Barron River near by. This was to supply the gold fields to the West. getting over the ranges was a very difficult endeavour as this range is very steep through dense tropical rainforest (jungle). A better port was needed and Trinity Inlet was chosen. Smithfield was virtually wiped out with a big flood about this time and many moved to the new port that is now Cairns. Smithfield was rebuilt further from the river but it never grew as before. A railway was eventually built up the sides of the Barron Gorge to the Atherton Tablelands and Smithfield became even less important as the old mountain track was abandoned. Getting West from Townsville was a lot easier as the ranges are not so high or steep and the bush is not dense rain forest. This made it easier to head inland for miners and graziers. It is also better for getting their products to port. Charters Towers is a Gold mining City (a small city) not far inland from Townsville. Mount Isa is also inland from Townsville and the railway goes out that far. This is almost to the Northern Territory Border. Townsville to Charters Towers is about 130km, to Mount Isa it is about 900km.

As the existence of Cairns shows that towns can be in the north, why hasn t it grown to the same size as Brisbane as a second major city in QLD? Jakeman Vanderwolf Brisbane is located where the Moreton Bay penal colony was established in 1825. The Moreton Bay penal colony was established to house recidivist convicts from Sydney, some 900 kilometres south. By the 1820s, Sydney had become quite prosperous through exporting wheat and wool and needed to shrug off its convict colony stain . Ships needed deep water to dock in to bring in building materials. The terrain surrounding Brisbane river at the time was densely forested and inaccessible. Ships were the only way for Europeans to bring goods and people in and out. (Local indigenous people had mastered the landscape over Millenia.) Brisbane river, named after NSW Governor, Sir Thomas Brisbane, is a large deep water tidal river with access to calm water Moreton Bay, which is itself protected by large sand islands such as Moreton and Stradbroke Islands, making it ideal as a shipping port. The convict colony was closed in 1839 and the renamed Brisbane town opened for free European settlement in 1842. Only two of the original convict buildings survive and the CBD streets were reconfigured into the House of Hanover (streets named after Queen Victoria s family) grid you see today. German missionaries had also already established a settlement at Zion Hill in nearby Nundah in 1837. Nundah was created from the German for now there . By 1859, when Queensland was granted separation from NSW as a separate crown colony, Brisbane was the largest settlement and chosen to be capital of the fledgling colony. (Other settlements, such as Ipswich and Gayndah had also been considered.) As capital, colonial government was conducted from Brisbane s impressive Parliament House and adjacent George Street government offices. Business offices tend to congregate around government offices for convenience, enhancing the population due to job and trade opportunities. When the six British colonies created in the Australian continent between 1788 and 1859 (NSW, Victoria, Queensland, WA, SA and Tasmania) federated to become The Commonwealth of Australia (CoA) in 1901, Brisbane became the capital of the state of Queensland. Cairns is located in a different climate zone to Brisbane, some 1700 kilometres north. Cairns is tropical, Brisbane, sub-tropical. Cairns is surrounded by coral reef and islands, making it less accessible to ships until ports were established in the late nineteenth century on Trinity Inlet. Cairns can also experience tropical cyclones, making it less desirable for settlement. Cairns was established in 1876 as a port for the Palmer river gold rush. Many ports in Australia were established during gold rushes in the later half of the 19th century. The second major city in Queensland is Gold Coast, located 60 kilometres south of the Brisbane CBD, at a population of 714 000. (Greater Brisbane s population is 2.6 million.) Gold Coast grew rapidly due to lifestyle and leisure pursuits of Queenslanders and other Australians after the abolishing of death duties by the Queensland coalition state government in the 1970s as well as from domestic and international tourism. Cairns mainly relies on tourism. It s population is around 154 000. Townsville, also located in the tropics, is larger at 200 000 and a more strategic port as it houses a military defence base. Townsville also has a larger population due to its surrounding twin industries of beef cattle and mining and is less reliant on tourism.
