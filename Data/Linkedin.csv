Best schools in Abu Dhabi,"This week concludes my first year as an Aeronautical Engineering & STEM Educator for high school students! For the past year, I have been working as a full time teacher for a new initiative in high schools across Abu Dhabi, UAE. This initiative aims to incorporate aeronautics into private schools to push the youth towards becoming pilots, aeronautical engineers and pioneers in the aviation sector. It was such an honor for me to work with the brightest minds of our youths, and I look forward to see what they have to offer in the months to come! I found this job immediately after graduating my Bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering and it felt very unfamiliar at first. Having the tables turned from being a student for over 18 years to being an educator was quite the change in perspective . However, it gave me invaluable insights into how we learn new concepts as engineers, and how we facilitate and assist one another as colleagues. This experience was so unique and beneficial, I believe every aspiring engineer should have the pleasure of being an educator for atleast a few months. Here is some of what I learnt -> A key concept of being an educator is to transfer knowledge to your students briefly, in a simple manner. As Einstein once said ""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."" -> Every person is unique. You hear it often but it is different experiencing it first hand. Everyone learns their own way, on their own time, using their own methods. Managing your students to ensure all of them excel with a high level of attainment brought the best out of me. This taught me so much about being a leader. -> Some days I found myself learning from my students. They are very creative and have unexpected solution to modern day problems. Especially when they are so proficient with AI tools. Now, Im excited to reconnect with my aerospace engineering roots! After a year of teaching aeronautics and STEM, Im eager to apply these skills in new ways. Whether through advanced technical projects, collaborative engineering roles, or mentoring the next generation of innovators.

UAE school holidays,"I came to the UAE for 2 weeks and stayed for 10 years. A heartfelt welcome to all educators flying in this week and beginning their teaching journeys in the UAE. A whirlwind of emotions, Im sure, as you try to make sense of it all: the adrenaline that comes with exciting new beginnings the heat - it does get better, I promise! the endless questions racing through your mind - those never stop, but that just means youre growing My journey began with a two-week holiday to the UAE, and one canceled return flight later, I found myself fully immersed in a thriving educational community. That was a decade ago. Heres why I'd do it all over again in a heartbeat: 1. The UAE is a cultural melting pot. Its like a daily lesson in global citizenship. You'll naturally start to understand and appreciate a wide range of cultures and perspectives. 2. Ive never felt safer in a country. Top-notch security allows you to enjoy your time here fully, whether youre out exploring or simply living day-to-day. 3. The professional development opportunities here are endless. Ive learned so much more than I ever imagined, all thanks to a supportive community. 4. You receive a tax-free salary = more financial freedom. 5. Many schools here have facilities you would expect to see in universities. The smart classrooms and modern resources really help you bring learning to life. 6. The UAEs location makes it easy to visit other parts of the world. Youll find yourself learning from different cultures, which can bring great value to your teaching. 7. Theres a strong focus on enjoying life outside of work, and in my opinion, this helps keep you inspired in the classroom. 8. In the UAE, teaching is a respected profession. 9. The UAE continues to push boundaries in education, so you will have the chance to be at the cutting edge of new teaching methods/technologies. 10. Living abroad has a way of moving you out of your comfort zone. Its one of the best ways to grow, both as a person and as a teacher. If you are feeling nervous about this week, know that countless educators have walked this path before you. We came, we saw, and we fell in love with teaching in the UAE. Your adventure is just beginning. Welcome to the next chapter of your life Special thanks toandMiddle East for my first opportunity in international education. more",10 months ago,,"I came to the UAE for 2 weeks and stayed for 10 years.

UAE school calendar,"Key Trends in UAE Legal Recruitment for June 2025! Strong Demand for Legal Talent The UAE legal sector is experiencing robust demand for lawyers, particularly in high-growth practice areas such as capital markets, banking and finance, corporate M&A, construction (both contentious and non-contentious), international arbitration/litigation, employment, energy and infrastructure projects, and financial services regulatory work. Law firms, both local and international, are expanding their teams, with a notable increase in lateral partner moves, especially in sectors like energy, project finance, and dispute resolution. Recruitment Cycles and Market Dynamics The summer period (MarchJune) sees a spike in legal hiring due to post-bonus resignations and the end of the school year, leading to both temporary and permanent opportunities as firms and in-house teams replace departing staff. The market remains highly competitive, with firms seeking candidates who have strong academic backgrounds and qualifications from common law jurisdictions (UK, US, Australia, South Africa, Singapore, New Zealand, Pakistan, and India), and at least two years of experience in a relevant practice area. Specialisations in High Demand There is a marked increase in demand for legal professionals with expertise in regulatory compliance, data protection, and governance, reflecting the UAEs evolving regulatory landscape and alignment with international standards. In-house legal departments and compliance functions are also expanding, with roles such as General Counsel, Legal Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer, and Compliance Manager among the most sought-after positions. Salary Trends Legal professionals in the UAE can expect modest salary growth in 2025, with the sector projected to see low single-digit increases. This is driven by strong demand for specialised legal expertise and increased competition among employers, although salary growth may not match the pace of job creation Interested to chat more?

Dubai has always attracted the global elite from luxury real estate and world-class infrastructure to its tax-friendly environment. But now, it's raising the bar once again this time in education.

Wealthy individuals are increasingly seeking more than prestige; they want future-proof, tech-driven learning environments that rival or exceed top-tier institutions in the U.S. and U.K. This new GEMS flagship offers: A cutting-edge British curriculum A strong focus on entrepreneurship, STEM, and innovation Intimate class sizes (as small as 16 students per class) AI-powered learning tools and a startup incubator model What This Means for Investors This evolution of Dubais educational sector reflects the citys ongoing transformation into a global hub for affluent families. As schooling options reach new levels of excellence, Dubai becomes even more attractive for: Real estate investors targeting family-oriented luxury communities Wealth advisors and relocation consultants Entrepreneurs looking to tap into an ecosystem fueled by elite capital and next-gen talent In a city where lifestyle is already second to none, education is now the next frontier.

Is UAE education worth it?,"I've been actively seeking teaching opportunities in the UAE since September. In that time, Ive attended job fairs, connected with mentors, spoken to recruitment consultants, and sent over 100 CVs across the Gulfincluding the UAE, Qatar, and Kuwait. Ive received rejections, silence, and generic messagesmany of which focus on one thing: the fact that I am a mother of three. One of the first recruitment companies I worked with dismissed my application based on incorrect assumptions about visa sponsorships and the cost of schooling for children. I was told, bluntly, that I could not afford to live in the UAE on a teachers salarywithout a single question about my actual family situation. This week, another recruiter asked, Is your husband working too? It may be difficult for schools to justify three child places. Let me be clear: I have never demanded tuition coverage. And I will not accept that my motherhood is seen as a liability. Ive lived and worked in the UAE for over 15 years. This is a society where having many children is considered a blessingand it has never stopped women from pursuing meaningful and successful careers. I deeply understand the cultural and societal context of the country, and I truly value how family-oriented it is.

I was worried about what everyone would think, I love Norfolk and have loved growing up there. For us the timing of the opportunity was just right. Whether its financial gain/ for your children/ or just for you, there is no right or wrong answer. The 3 biggest things to understand with a relocation with children: 1. Visa, there are so many great companies that can help with this, doing it yourself is an option, just may take a bit longer, we opted for the first option. 2. School enrollment. Dubai's schooling is pretty impressive, to secure a place, you'll have to submit an online application form for most schools and pay a non-refundable application fee, there is also quite often a waiting list. 3. House. We rented a furnished apartment for 6 weeks, whilst waiting for furniture to be shipped from the UK, although this took much longer than quoted! Once you find your property you have to pay estate agent fees, landlord deposit (if renting) and register your property. The process includes signing your tenancy contract, registering for Ejari (Dubai's real estate regulation authority), and paying a % to set up your DEWA, which is your utilities.

Waiting lists Dubai schools,"A new year feels like a fresh start, doesnt it? Its like hitting the reset button.

Celebrating New Year Away from home: But celebrating the New Year in a different country, away from family, is a whole different experience.

School transfers UAE,"This week concludes my first year as an Aeronautical Engineering & STEM Educator for high school students! For the past year, I have been working as a full time teacher for a new initiative in high schools across Abu Dhabi, UAE. This initiative aims to incorporate aeronautics into private schools to push the youth towards becoming pilots, aeronautical engineers and pioneers in the aviation sector. It was such an honor for me to work with the brightest minds of our youths, and I look forward to see what they have to offer in the months to come! I found this job immediately after graduating my Bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering and it felt very unfamiliar at first. Having the tables turned from being a student for over 18 years to being an educator was quite the change in perspective . However, it gave me invaluable insights into how we learn new concepts as engineers, and how we facilitate and assist one another as colleagues. This experience was so unique and beneficial, I believe every aspiring engineer should have the pleasure of being an educator for atleast a few months. Here is some of what I learnt -> A key concept of being an educator is to transfer knowledge to your students briefly, in a simple manner. As Einstein once said ""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."" -> Every person is unique. You hear it often but it is different experiencing it first hand. Everyone learns their own way, on their own time, using their own methods. Managing your students to ensure all of them excel with a high level of attainment brought the best out of me. This taught me so much about being a leader. -> Some days I found myself learning from my students. They are very creative and have unexpected solution to modern day problems. Especially when they are so proficient with AI tools. Now, Im excited to reconnect with my aerospace engineering roots!

However, it gave me invaluable insights into how we learn new concepts as engineers, and how we facilitate and assist one another as colleagues. This experience was so unique and beneficial, I believe every aspiring engineer should have the pleasure of being an educator for atleast a few months. Here is some of what I learnt -> A key concept of being an educator is to transfer knowledge to your students briefly, in a simple manner. As Einstein once said ""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."" -> Every person is unique. You hear it often but it is different experiencing it first hand. Everyone learns their own way, on their own time, using their own methods. Managing your students to ensure all of them excel with a high level of attainment brought the best out of me. This taught me so much about being a leader. -> Some days I found myself learning from my students. They are very creative and have unexpected solution to modern day problems. Especially when they are so proficient with AI tools. Now, Im excited to reconnect with my aerospace engineering roots!

The Pakistani curriculum is still heavily reliant on rote memorization and knowledge recall, with limited room for skills development or real-world application.

Dr. Tim Hughes is the Director of Academic Quality Assurance and School Improvement, Bloom Education, UAE. Let's get into some of my take aways and tips! Achievement /Data-Driven Decisions: Each SLT member was assigned to a particular group and did a data capture. This included SLT members doing rigorous tracking and creating a profile with all observations and records from teachers, students, parents. All standardized and non-standardized data for the group they monitor determines the progress made. Achievement was rated OUTSTANDING! Quality of Teaching/ Curriculum Innovation: Scrapping established lesson plan proforma and replaced it with a learner plan that focused on what students had to learn in order to make good or outstanding progress. Quality of Teaching /Teacher Development: All CPDs were focused on how to deliver outstanding lessons with the MOT (Moving On Together) motto where teachers shared best practices and took charge of CPDs. Quality of Teaching was rated OUTSTANDING! Positive Behaviour Behaviour improved due to a behaviour system being implemented and teachers made 1 phone call per day to parents to share feedback and give praise. Behaviour was rated OUTSTANDING! Leadership and Continuous Improvement: Developed and implemented the Area of Improvement Process (AIP) strategy that was used to improve every leader. The process involves every 'area', e.g. subjects, in an internal review process that uses Ofsted's framework to review performance and set improvement targets. After days of observations and interviews the review leader has to write a report (this also deliberately mimics a typical Ofsted format). Accountability for the quality of each area is not only secured through the AIP and through the line management process, but each middle leader is questioned directly by the Board of Governors. Leadership was seen as securing improvement and was rated OUTSTANDING! I found Dr. Tim's approach inspiring! It shows uniformity on how every stakeholder is held accountable and challenged to be the best version of themselves. It was also refreshing to see that actions being taken were aimed equally at leaders in schools and not just focused on teacher scrutiny. What have you done as a school leader to secure an outstanding rating by OES How have you held school leaders accountable Rubric only I recommend the following: 1. All schools should have a uniformed system in place to motivate and generate evidence of actions taken by all leaders to secure improvement. A review panel should be formed. 2.

New school regulations UAE,"I was happy to see mental health being prioritized through the new Mental Wealth Framework initiative launched by Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed. I appreciate this initiative not only as a mental health professional, but also as someone who calls Dubai home! From my experience in mental health and Inclusion, I believe two key areas need attention: 1. Inclusive schools beyond curriculum adjustments: To make schools more inclusive, especially for students with sensory sensitivities, we should create spaces like sensory rooms or use visual signals, such as lights or digital screens, to indicate transition times instead of loud bells. Other adjustments could include: - Visual schedules and reminders - Break areas for self-regulation - Alternative communication tools - Task breakdowns and visual supports And develop clear pathways for Students of Determination after graduation, whether for college or independent living (when possible). 2. Mental health at work especially for mothers: Women make up about 40% of the UAE workforce (According to 2021 Women, Peace and Security Index). Revisiting the duration of maternity leave and exploring flexible options like hybrid or online work can support a smoother transition back to work, and help the child develop a secure attachment style which is essential for their holistic wellbeing. Research from the Canadian Pediatric Society indicates that babies start responding to their mothers smile by 4 weeks and expect her response by 4 to 6 months when upset. Not only that, but these early interactions have an effect on brain physiology, generating the circuits that are responsible for affect regulation and stress recovery mechanisms especially in the first 6-7 months. (According to educational psychologist, Anne Peake in Oxfordshire) How can we fully experience these milestones, and help the child develop a healthy secure attachment, if we return to work too soon? - Im grateful for this initiative and believe that continued research is essential to implement effective interventions.

Other adjustments could include: - Visual schedules and reminders - Break areas for self-regulation - Alternative communication tools - Task breakdowns and visual supports And develop clear pathways for Students of Determination after graduation, whether for college or independent living (when possible). 2. Mental health at work especially for mothers: Women make up about 40% of the UAE workforce (According to 2021 Women, Peace and Security Index). Revisiting the duration of maternity leave and exploring flexible options like hybrid or online work can support a smoother transition back to work, and help the child develop a secure attachment style which is essential for their holistic wellbeing. Research from the Canadian Pediatric Society indicates that babies start responding to their mothers smile by 4 weeks and expect her response by 4 to 6 months when upset. Not only that, but these early interactions have an effect on brain physiology, generating the circuits that are responsible for affect regulation and stress recovery mechanisms especially in the first 6-7 months. (According to educational psychologist, Anne Peake in Oxfordshire) How can we fully experience these milestones, and help the child develop a healthy secure attachment, if we return to work too soon? - Im grateful for this initiative and believe that continued research is essential to implement effective interventions. What do you think should also be highlighted to prioritize wellbeing? more. Thanks Omar glad you found it helpful!",0.4837581515312195,True

UAE Emiratization in schools,"From my formal and non-formal interactions with young UAE Nationals throughout my experience in Employability, Learning and Development and Emiratization, I can conclude that we must focus our attention in the next few years on building a robust plan to enhance their career awareness. Career awareness is ones ability to develop a full understanding of potential career fields, opportunities, and long-term employments, and what it takes to become employable and satisfied in a career. A lot of young people in the UAE hear about this term late in their education and specifically at university, while I believe career awareness should start from an early age during school time. Building career awareness takes time and it starts at home with parents helping their kids find their own unique passion in life by observing their preferred hobbies and interests and special capabilities. At a later stage, parents are expected to empower their kids by providing them with personal autonomy to decide what they want to study at university and how they wish to contribute to their community instead of imposing some difficult options that might make their kids end up with disappointment and regret. Educational institutions should also consider developing a full-fledged subject that focuses on career awareness and labor market current and future expectations. This subject can include resume writing skills, job interview skills, job search skills, workplace etiquette, ethics at work, business writing skills and many others. As part of our corporate social responsibility, we as employers are also expected to play our role in empowering youth by building partnerships with schools and universities with the aim of enhancing career awareness of students in more structured and effective way that can yield tangible outcomes. This can be achieved through actively participating in career events and initiatives that target university and school students to share our industry knowledge and labor market evolving demands and expectations. Employers can also inspire students by hosting field visits to allow students understand the realities of working in banking industry, hospitality industry, oil and gas industry or others. When young students are well-acquainted with market labour expectations and future career opportunities, they are more likely to make better career choices, and ultimately find the right career opportunities when they graduate from university.

Drop your thoughts, tag a policy innovator, or share how your region is responding.","$200 Billion. One Handshake. A New AI Order? Just this past week, a historic moment unfolded in Abu Dhabi. U.S. President Donald Trump stood at the groundbreaking of a $200 billion AI-focused supercomputing city in the UAE, the worlds largest of its kind. But this wasnt just about technology. It was about power and the global reordering of influence. The UAE is no longer playing catch-up. Its mandating AI in schools from KG to Grade 12, training a new generation to lead in an AI-powered economy. But heres the deeper question: Will this AI revolution create inclusive opportunity, or widen the digital divide for the Global South and vulnerable populations? What does a U.S.UAE alliance on AI signal about the future of tech diplomacy? This Sunday's article unpacks: The geopolitical shift from China to the U.S. Why AI literacy isnt just coding - its ethics, equity & education policy. What educators and policymakers must do now to protect and prepare the next generation. If you care about where the world is headed - If youre a teacher, policymaker, or just someone who believes in a more just and human-centered future - Read, reflect, and re-share this critical breakdown. The real world implications of AI cannot be left to world leaders, diplomats and developers alone. Educators, learners, and workers must co-author the future - or risk being written out of it.

UAE STEM education,"#uae The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has long been a business-friendly hub with zero personal income tax, attracting global investors. The introduction of a 9% corporate tax in 2023 marks a major fiscal shift aimed at enhancing resilience, diversification, and sustainability. Unlike conventional tax policies, the UAE reinvests tax revenues into high-growth industries, reinforcing its position as a global business leader. This corporate tax serves as a transformation tool, funding infrastructure, healthcare, and education. Projects like Etihad Rail, Hyperloop, and smart cities are boosting connectivity and sustainability, while port expansions, free zones, and trade corridors are strengthening the UAEs role in global trade. Significant investments in AI-driven healthcare, biotech, and medical tourism are modernizing the sector. Education and workforce development are also key, with initiatives like AI universities and STEM programs ensuring a skilled workforce. Despite corporate taxation, the UAE remains highly competitive, with a low 9% rate, far below Germany (29.9%), the UK (25%), and the US (21%). This business-friendly tax model continues to attract multinational firms and foreign investment. The UAEs non-oil sector has surged, with its GDP share rising from 55% in 2015 to 75% by 2025. Technology & AI (22.2%), fintech (13.6%), and renewable energy (25%) are among the fastest-growing industries. Tourism (12.5%), logistics (10%), and healthcare (25%) also see strong expansion.

UAE standardized testing,"EMSAT Standardized Testing Scrapped Reflecting on my journey with the Ministry of Education UAE, where I started back in 2018, our team put immense effort into creating resources for students preparing for their EMSAT exams. Back then, students had limited study materials, so we built a bank of exam-style questions and two-hour practice tests to mirror the real exams. We analyzed this data to pinpoint the skills where students needed the most support. One challenge we faced was the EMSAT curriculum not being fully integrated into the Grade 12 syllabus, which meant extra support sessions were required outside of school hours. This added pressure on teachers, who had to provide this support during evenings or weekendsa less-than-ideal situation. Another issue was the timing. The exams ran every two weeks on weekends from November, with most students taking them at the start of Grade 12, before theyd fully developed or practiced the necessary skills. Furthermore, schools didnt receive direct results. Teachers had to ask students for their scores, adding a layer of complexity to tracking progress. Then came COVID, which moved everything online and paused the progress we were making in supporting students. more",7 months ago,,"EMSAT Standardized Testing Scrapped Reflecting on my journey with the Ministry of Education UAE, where I started back in 2018, our team put immense effort into creating resources for students preparing for their EMSAT exams.

UAE standardized testing,"ENTRY LEVEL TESTS IN UAE SCHOOLS Part - 2 As discussed in the previous post (Part-1), ELT plays a supreme role in making the student aware that I cannot simply sneak into any school without passing a certain exam. At the same time it gives school an idea of the level of student, which grade and division he should be admitted, who should be the class teacher, any specific strategies if needed to apply for him.

UAE adult education,"Imagine starting your career with $0 student debt and keeping almost 100% of your salary! The other day, I had a conversation with my buddy about the higher cost of education and taxes we face as U.S. citizens. It made me reflect even more after reading amazing post about her move to the UAE and how it completely changed her financial future. (If you havent seen it yet, definitely check it out!) Speaking personally Ive seen how expensive education is here in the U.S. Whether through my own experiences or watching friends graduate with six-figure debt, its clear that starting adult life in deep financial holes has become the norm. But if we start thinking globally, there are smarter financial paths: 1. Study abroad in countries like Germany, Norway, or France where education is low-cost or even free even for international students. 2. Work abroad in tax-friendly places like Dubai, where your full salary stays in your pocket without a massive tax bill. Here's one powerful example: Germany: Undergraduate and graduate degrees with virtually no tuition Save $200,000+ in loans Dubai: 0% income tax Keep 2540% more of every paycheck 5-year outcome: ~$400,000$450,000 take-home income plus no student loan payments (Germany+Dubai path) vs. ~$280,000 take-home income (traditional U.S. path) plus student loans. HUGE DIFFERENCE! And for U.S. citizens you can legally exclude ~$126,500/year of foreign income through the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion if you meet the requirements. The system is global now. So just to recap: Go to college in germany, then settle in dubai after graduation with US citizenship career path. Thoughts? Why limit yourself to one countrys rules when the world is full of opportunities? Saving a fortune and building one, too.
