Transforming education: the Alef Education story,https://www.reuters.com/plus/acumen/vision-2045/aec,Date not found,"Alef Education is reshaping the education sector globally through AI-powered solutions, strategic collaborations and innovative initiatives","Published:February 19, 2025/ Updated undefined ago
Alef Educationis reshaping the education sector globally through AI-powered solutions, strategic collaborations and innovative initiatives
Education is a cornerstone of a developed, inclusive, and prosperous society. However, due to socioeconomic disparities, limited access to resources, inadequate infrastructure, and a need for trained educators, quality education remains out of reach for millions of children. According to theUNESCO Global Education Monitoring Report 2024, 251 million children and young people worldwide lack access to education. Overcoming these challenges requires a combination of innovation, collaboration and commitment—the pillars on which Alef Education operates.
Founded in the United Arab Emirates in 2016, Alef Education began as a homegrown company focused on supporting the country’s vision to achieve technological advancements in all key areas, including education. The company is now a global leader in education technology, fostering human capital development by providing personalised learning experiences and giving young people the tools they need to succeed in the Information Age.
The EdTech company’s strength lies in utilising cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), augmented and virtual reality, and big data to improve student learning outcomes. Its flagship AI-powered solution, theAlef Platform, helped students in Abu Dhabi achieve a 12.1% improvement in the final exams. In Indonesia, student performance improved by 8.5%, while in Morocco, students saw a 13.3% increase in Arabic diagnostic test scores.
Other AI-powered solutions includeAbjadiyat,Arabits, theAlef Pathwaysproduct suite, the Alef Guardian app and theAlef Metaverse. With these tools, the company has reached over 1.1 million students and partnered with approximately 7,000 schools in the United Arab Emirates, the USA, Indonesia, Morocco and Saudi Arabia.
“The future of education lies in innovation and inclusion. At Alef Education, we are dedicated to reshaping education by integrating technology into classrooms and improving student learning outcomes worldwide,” said Geoffrey Alphonso, CEO of Alef Education.
To ensure that AI complements rather than diminishes the role of teachers, Alef Education offers comprehensive professional development programmes that equip educators with the skills and knowledge to use technology in their classrooms. The Alef Academy offers self-study courses and resources focusing on practical implementation strategies and best practices for digital learning. The company’s teacher training initiatives have increased student engagement by 7.48%.
In addition to its innovative solutions and impactful development programmes, Alef Education has partnered with multiple government stakeholders, tech giantsMicrosoft, Googleand Amazon Web Services, academic institutions worldwide, and organisations such as MetaMetrics® to leverage the collective expertise and resources to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4, which focuses on ensuring inclusive, equitable and quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all; as well as SDG 13, which focuses on urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. To achieve this, as a strategic partner of the UAE Ministry of Education at COP28, the company raised awareness of climate change and encouraged sustainable practices by introducing the innovative Alef Metaverse experience and the EcoChamps course to promote climate education and environmental sustainability.
Alef Education has a bold mission: to make education accessible to all and improve outcomes through AI-powered personalised learning and the latest pedagogical frameworks rooted in data science. By bringing AI-powered personalised learning to the forefront and using data-driven insights, the company is helping to create a world where education is not a privilege but a right accessible to every child.
Ahead of the United Nations’ 100-year anniversary in 2045, the Vision campaign showcases a series of thought-provoking documentaries that cover topics from climate change through to equity and inclusivity.",Author not found
