some of schools, to which we first would need to qualify, are keeping waiting list. does anyone know if situation is any better at the start of term 1 or at the start of term 2? second - how bad is aldar education and schools made by real estate developers? i had a look on their facilities and some of them have awful reviews i will come back to this later, are these are anything more than shiny new buildings and swimming pools surrounded by shiny housing compounds? third - did you or your spouse drive kidkids to school or you used school buses? is it safe to put there 4-5 year old? how kids behave there. school buses in our current country have rather a mediocre opinions as driver is focused on the road and not teens and their activities in last rows. fourth - adek and school rating. initially i looked at these and avoided averting from good and below, but then i read on which school advisor that this rating refers mostly to school declarations and values, thus comparison of inspection ratings is hardly possible. fifth - arabic classes - how complex is this education, and does it leave any space for any other foreign language? currently our older kid, beyond mothers language, learns english and spanish. sixth - does healthcare suppliers offer the standard programs known from eu to spot early specific kinds of diseases cancers for people in specific age. asking here as we, as parents, are soon reaching our 40s which put us on some screening programs in home country. would like to conduct these in uae, just to do not grow by accident any tumor. for context - will be working in it in masdar city, above individual con00tributor, but still below manager level. i have a schooling allowance for each kid, thus i know exactly when i will start pulling diram from my own pocket. the entire dance is balancing cost of school, rent at the cost of smaller savings. ideally i would like to stay a bit above allowance, not only to fully utilize it, but also to avoid troubles with private lessons. over course of past years, my wife had just too much of driving through country roads in our home district, and uae seem to be.. driving a lot. if we cross allowance limit by far, i wish to do it for a valid reason. since we are not a british origin and have no uk passport i initially looked at ib curriculum rather than british. on ibo.org a bit above limits, but within close range, the american international school aisa is cheaper, but its opposite direction of masdar. the british international school of abu0dabi bisad seem to be located in middle of nowhere, and way beyond the limit. because older kid would need to go through english as additional language eal, it will also put additional weight on the fees. still bisad was first to answer us and give a clear it catches up stuff quickly, yet putting 18kaed year on top of regular fee is a lot. and just when it will be be up to speed to drop eal, both older and younger will reach higher grade.. resulting in same pressure on the budget. finally opinions, or lack of the balance in these. we all know that one hurt person will tell about its experience to 10 others while a happy person will rarely publish reference letters. but reading through parent assessment on whichschooladvisor.com, raha is really bad both on which school advisor and google. i guess only some of aldar schools could challenge it, with yasmina british academy. final remarks, trdr ? i would love to hit a school and housing within close range up to 10-15 min drive, but reading through some posts here i found that relocations within the city are simply unavoidable. we do not know if we will be in uae for two years or longer. is it worth risking savings for a premium school? i am not afraid of not-fitting in higher class caste bisad, bsak, after all nether i or my wife are professorsurgeondiplomat, but simple fact that we will not be able to keep our kids on even the track with their peers. prime point of moving to emirates is to boost english skills of kids, giving them international experience, but to be fair, they will grow this ability regardless of the school, even in a playground. i know that without allowance i will have hard times getting my kids into private international school in our home country, because its more of luxury good reserved for celebrities and rich people which i do not consider myself of. with 20 years to my retirement i have to start being consistent, while investment in kids will hopefully pay them well in future, it will also reduce our pension.",0.6209543943405151,0.004986841697245836,True

not me begging, but asking you for advice as you know the uae best. i do not know what to do in regards of everything. this might be a long post because i want you to understand my situation. i just want advice on how to proceed with my life. i want to invest myself into something but i do not know what. for the last 4 years, my father has been unemployed. we have always relied on him as our main source of income. before his unemployment, i was in school, finishing up 9th grade, i was oblivious to everything and naive. life was life. i had in mind what everyone else did, i will finish school, graduate college, and find a job. i do not know where to start from. we have always lived in apartments since we are foreigners, it is not easy for us in a country like this to get a house. my fathers work paid for insurance, rent, provided a car, paid for fuel, and had a good salary. we were able to make ends meet no problem. i could occasionally go out with my friends, we could go out as a family, we could buy things we wanted. it was not any crazy wealth we were normal just money management. after he lost his job we lost everything. first the car, then the insurance, and then we got evicted out of our apartment by a court order. for 4 years we have been barely making it by. donations, help from friends and, and some free lancing work my mother was able to do. unfortunately now, my father is getting old, and hes not managed to land anything. and my mothers health situation makes it very difficult for her to continue her freelance work. she still does it sometimes, but her body can not handle doing it long enough to support us. i was able to graduate highschool july of this year. i did not feel the happiness or the joy people talk about when they graduate. it was nothing to me, just disappointed, because i knew there is more to come. i have performed academically well and i think that is the only reason that i was able to graduate. i was allowed to continue because of my performance, we still have money left to pay to the school, and it is been almost 5 months. i graduated first on my class, 98.3, i have done my sat which a friend paid for and scored 1120. my sat mark is not good because i was focusing almost everything on school, i had 3 sets exams every term instead of 2, and there were some national tests i had to finish. so it was difficult for me to put more attention towards the sat. i have studied a lot. the school was not prestigious but it was not easy either. i really invested every piece of my soul towards school. in 11th grade, i did not have electricity for exams, and i did not have wifi, so i spent most of my time in either a hospital, cafe, or a friends house for wifi. i managed to finish that grade and got second placd with97. i was hoping that what i invested in school then, would pay off now, but it did not. because i did not perform astoundingly well. i was a normal student, my school marks are high, but my sat is not. and i cannot afford to take the ielts which was very important for college applications. i have done a national test on english because it was free. i have scored 1825 out of 2000, it is the ielts equivalent of 7ish. the test is not recognised outside the country do there was no use for it. now for college, before i graduated i was researching and hoping to get a scholarship. i got offers, but non of them covered everything, and it was very difficult for me to cover the rest and i could not guarantee it. initially i wanted to study computer engineering, but right now i am fine with anything as long as i can get out of this situation. i have dreamed of studying in germany for most of my school year. i do not know why germany, but i found that there was no way i could make it because i needed money. i have looked into other countries like turkey, romania, ukraine, saudi arabia, united arab emirates, brunei, netherlands, and ireland. any country that had scholarships, cheap, or i just had family there. nothing really seemed to work out. i really do not know where these last 5 months went. it is depressing, i cannot mention much that i managed to do.i wanted to look for work. but in this country, it was very difficult for someone like me with barely any experience or qualifications to find a job. i managed to land 2 interviews but nothing other than that. i have completed a google it course from coursera because i was offered financial aid, but that did not improve my chances much. i feel like everything is just made to suck the life out of you. everytime i wanna do something i am met with a 100 barriers. i have to relearn everything before i proceed. and i feel like everything that i did was for nothing. it makes me wish i did not stay up all night to study for my exams, or put effort into anything if it was going to turn out like this. i hope what i am saying is making sense, i do not want it to come as a lie or i am just not putting enough effort. i really do not know what i can do. i relied on my parents for everything, that is how things were, but now i am being hit by this huge responsibility all of a sudden. for my future and my family. i had to adjust a lot of things so suddenly. my brothers are home because we cannot afford them education. we can not receive anymore financial help, colleges in this country do not want to cover all of my fees, i can not get a job. and anything that i will start to do now to earn money, will not have enough of a result to resolve this situation. i am willing to invest myself into anything. i am not trying to say that i will not work because it is not enough, but it is because my time is running out. my residency ends next month, we have managed to keep it but now will probably be the end of it. in my country, we have nothing. no family, no home, no money. not after my grandfather died. we have built everything here, everything fell apart, and all that is left is for us to fall with it. and now with corona, things are only more tight. we could get evicted out of where we are staying any second now. i am not here to beg or ask for anything. please just tell me what can i do. i recently turned 18 so at least that gives me some freedom. it kinda makes it worse because i cannot be sponsored by either of my parents unless i am working or studying and i cannot seem to manage to do either. please direct me to anywhere where i might be able to study, or just something to do. i have not prepared or expected this, and now i have to manage everything. i really do not know what to do. my brain has hit a roadblock. my physical health is fine snd i do not suffer from any mental illnesses. i am just lost. i am prepared to relight myself up to work towards something. but idk what that something is, i jsut want an opportunity tldr financial situation in ruins, parents incapable of work, were running out of time and i do not know what to do save myself and my

the picture. pulling out your bank card at each failure attaches a negative emotion to the process and this adds to the pressure during exams. plus, with all the added fees reattempts, dl issuance fee the whole process will anyway come close to the lump-sum package cost youll maybe save 1.5k 3. dont compare yourself with others who have gotten their dl in the first attempt at all levels. i would say this is like a 5 minority. but then again, they are the most verbal at social gatherings and would try to make it sound so easy to make themselves feel good. 4. select the right school. it should be closer to where you are and at the same time sufficiently staffed. selecting a poorly run school will delay the process as there will be weeks apart between slots. i have heard good things about emdi, exds and belhasa as these are properly staffed with plenty trainers. mcq test this should be easy enough, watch the videos, do your mocks again and again until the questions get burnt into your head. rta mcqs are the same you get at the mocks. i mean these are road rules, how hard can they make it? i wont go much into this as this should be easy. driving lessons dont allow the reception staff to book all your sessions with one instructor. if you get a bad instructor, you wont learn anything from him. some instructors are bored with their job and will let you drive while being on the phone. you dont want that you are here to learn, so find an instructor who is putting in the effort. once you find him rebook rest of the sessions with him. ask him all the questions that you have and get it clarified. make mistakes and learn the rules even if you are a seasoned driver. you are in a new land, respect the requirements and put in the time and effort. book slots close as possible so that you dont waste time by booking far apart slots will depend on the schools available slots though, read foundation level initial driving assessment dont think the internal examiner is always out to fail you. they look for confidence and the ability to control the vehicle with ease. plus, if possible having paid the unlimited package will remove any incentive for the school to fail you. if you have paid good attention during lesson, followed all road rules and can drive with confidence, they will pass you, else they will recommend getting more lessons this is what failing entails, they are recommending you to get more lessons. i passed in my second attempt. parking training this is the level i have most beef with. specially the garage parking aspect, we will get to that soon. 1. the key to passing the parking level is slow slow slow, slow down your car to the point you are questioning whether it is moving or not. yes, you can not dry steer but if you are moving at 1 kmh it doesnt count as dry steering. the slower you do this easier it is to execute turns at points 2. get your seat adjustments right. i used to remember where the tip of my knee should be vs the window shutter control buttons. and the backrest. place your wrists on the steering wheel and adjust each time to the same distance. side mirrors as per the arabic letter method the instructor tells you. parking manoeuvres safety checks for all! 1. slope emergency break easy. dont worry about it. 2. angel parking find the point that works for you, usually its the door handle. but if you are taller or has long legs the point will shift a bit. identify it and remember it. since you are going as slow as humanly possible there will be plenty time to execute the turn. once committed to the turn move in slowly. when the elbow reaches the yellow horizontal line straighten the wheels and move in slowly. if you were told of a steering wheel vs corner align method, forget it. thats stupid and rarely works. i used to mess this up a lot simply by not slowing down, plus when it came to the turning, i used to subconsciously release the brake thereby increasing the speed. if you are slow, it cannot go wrong. keep telling yourself slow slow slow. you have about 3 minutes to do this manuver. use it. 3. garage parking this is trickiest out of them all. mainly because of how we are taught by the instructors on how to do it. do not try to do this in a single mauver, forget the sticker point method. thats like a dart, sometimes itll work mostly it wont. the sticker method will vary a lot on how tall you are, whether you wear glasses, you head position etc. just do two manoeuvres, full turn right and reverse towards the slot and do a judgement call midway, if you are about to cut the line simply drive forward and readjust the car in to the slot. the aim is to turn the car in as close as possible to the right-side corner of the slot without cutting it of course. rta will reduce 2 merit points for the forward drive but youll still pass it. this is the one i have most beef with. hear me out, no sensible human will try to garage park in a single manuver, yet we are taught and is expected to do this in one go. regular people would always drive forward and then adjust the car in as they reverse. idk why the rta expects otherwise. 4. parallel parking as always, the key is being slow as possible. learn to position car properly against the right-side line. learn the distance about a 1.5 feet and always try to start manuver with that same distance between the car and the line. if for some reason the car is further away from the line wait for the corner to come into the side mirror that same distance before turning left. if you start closer to the line turn as soon as the corner appears in the mirror. again, here i would like to make a note about paying lump-sum. i failed the internal parking 4 times before i chose to convert my package to unlimited out of frustration. once converted, i felt that the internal examiner tried his level best to pass me. there was a shift in how much he helped during the exam process, maybe its the conspiracy theorist in me taps the tin-foil hat but im pretty sure they can see who are lump-sum and who are regular. there are videos on youtube that does a good job in showing the manuvers. watch it before the exam. simply search dubai parking manuvers. i liked the video done from belhasa. rta smart yard parking i passed this in two attempts. there is no examiner so there is less pressure as you can make a fool of yourself. i must say not having a human in the car made this so much easier for me. i kept telling myself if i fail, ill simply come back, might as well make the best of paying for unlimited. good thing is you dont need to reattempt passed manuvers. rta final road test i passed this in the third attempt. the tip here would be to book the earliest slot on a sunday 7 am or 750 am. its 30 aed extra. there is little to no traffic and its mostly learner cars doing final exams. but the disadvantage would be most parking slots will be full making it difficult to park in a tight spot. pick your battle as per skill. additionally, if possible, during training, drive in the examination roads to make yourself familiarized with speed limits and potential stop signs. just ask the trainer to take you to where the exams will be conducted. during the rta road test, you can make 13 minor mistakes no head checks, lack of speed, parking line cut etc. but if you make one major mistake you will be failed traffic rule violation, examiner having to break or intervene etc the rta examiners are very mechanical. as you drive, they will mark minor and major mistakes on their tab, there are no judgement-based decisions. as soon as they notice a mistake, it getting added on the tab. imagine driving with a robot who is coded to note down mistakes. and the end of the test they check your mistake score and inform the result. however, if you seem extremely unconfident with controlling the vehicle and is driving all over the place, they will mark it as a major mistake and will fail you. rta examiners do this day-in-day out and can spot a bad driver within the first 2-3 minutes. a failure would mean you need more practise. simple as that. i dont think there is any hidden agenda behind rta examiners, they are just really good at spotting mistakes. to be honest, i understood why the rta examiners are tough on drivers, in my second attempt there was a guy with me and while he drove, i feared for my own life! and turns out he was attempting through the golden chance and had 15 years of driving experience back at home country. i was grateful for the examiner for failing him, just so that this guy not behind a wheel putting his and others life at risk. and he was extremely angry at the examiner for failing him in his second attempt! my advice is even if you are skilled driver with a lot of experience skip the golden chance. you are evaluated against students who had put in the time to go through the full process and that confidence shows at the exam and examiners use this as baseline to judge everyone. but if you really want to give it go, go for it. maybe youll luck out and pass! my final rta failures attempt 1 silly mistake of not stopping fully when entering the main road. there was no oncoming traffic and there was no stop sign but i should have known better. attempt 2 went above the speed limit by about 10 kmh. again, a silly mistake that could have been avoided. passed in the 3rd attempt. hope this helps someone as i picked up a lot of tips from reddit myself throughout the process. ama!",0.5037351846694946,0.006923758424818516,True

this easier it is to execute turns at points 2. get your seat adjustments right. i used to remember where the tip of my knee should be vs the window shutter control buttons. and the backrest. place your wrists on the steering wheel and adjust each time to the same distance. side mirrors as per the arabic letter method the instructor tells you. parking manoeuvres safety checks for all! 1. slope emergency break easy. dont worry about it. 2. angel parking find the point that works for you, usually its the door handle. but if you are taller or has long legs the point will shift a bit. identify it and remember it. since you are going as slow as humanly possible there will be plenty time to execute the turn. once committed to the turn move in slowly. when the elbow reaches the yellow horizontal line straighten the wheels and move in slowly. if you were told of a steering wheel vs corner align method, forget it. thats stupid and rarely works. i used to mess this up a lot simply by not slowing down, plus when it came to the turning, i used to subconsciously release the brake thereby increasing the speed. if you are slow, it cannot go wrong. keep telling yourself slow slow slow. you have about 3 minutes to do this manuver. use it. 3. garage parking this is trickiest out of them all. mainly because of how we are taught by the instructors on how to do it. do not try to do this in a single mauver, forget the sticker point method. thats like a dart, sometimes itll work mostly it wont. the sticker method will vary a lot on how tall you are, whether you wear glasses, you head position etc. just do two manoeuvres, full turn right and reverse towards the slot and do a judgement call midway, if you are about to cut the line simply drive forward and readjust the car in to the slot. the aim is to turn the car in as close as possible to the right-side corner of the slot without cutting it of course. rta will reduce 2 merit points for the forward drive but youll still pass it. this is the one i have most beef with. hear me out, no sensible human will try to garage park in a single manuver, yet we are taught and is expected to do this in one go. regular people would always drive forward and then adjust the car in as they reverse. idk why the rta expects otherwise. 4. parallel parking as always, the key is being slow as possible. learn to position car properly against the right-side line. learn the distance about a 1.5 feet and always try to start manuver with that same distance between the car and the line. if for some reason the car is further away from the line wait for the corner to come into the side mirror that same distance before turning left. if you start closer to the line turn as soon as the corner appears in the mirror. again, here i would like to make a note about paying lump-sum. i failed the internal parking 4 times before i chose to convert my package to unlimited out of frustration. once converted, i felt that the internal examiner tried his level best to pass me. there was a shift in how much he helped during the exam process, maybe its the conspiracy theorist in me taps the tin-foil hat but im pretty sure they can see who are lump-sum and who are regular. there are videos on youtube that does a good job in showing the manuvers. watch it before the exam. simply search dubai parking manuvers. i liked the video done from belhasa. rta smart yard parking i passed this in two attempts. there is no examiner so there is less pressure as you can make a fool of yourself. i must say not having a human in the car made this so much easier for me. i kept telling myself if i fail, ill simply come back, might as well make the best of paying for unlimited. good thing is you dont need to reattempt passed manuvers. rta final road test i passed this in the third attempt. the tip here would be to book the earliest slot on a sunday 7 am or 750 am. its 30 aed extra. there is little to no traffic and its mostly learner cars doing final exams. but the disadvantage would be most parking slots will be full making it difficult to park in a tight spot. pick your battle as per skill. additionally, if possible, during training, drive in the examination roads to make yourself familiarized with speed limits and potential stop signs. just ask the trainer to take you to where the exams will be conducted. during the rta road test, you can make 13 minor mistakes no head checks, lack of speed, parking line cut etc. but if you make one major mistake you will be failed traffic rule violation, examiner having to break or intervene etc the rta examiners are very mechanical. as you drive, they will mark minor and major mistakes on their tab, there are no judgement-based decisions. as soon as they notice a mistake, it getting added on the tab. imagine driving with a robot who is coded to note down mistakes. and the end of the test they check your mistake score and inform the result. however, if you seem extremely unconfident with controlling the vehicle and is driving all over the place, they will mark it as a major mistake and will fail you. rta examiners do this day-in-day out and can spot a bad driver within the first 2-3 minutes. a failure would mean you need more practise. simple as that. i dont think there is any hidden agenda behind rta examiners, they are just really good at spotting mistakes. to be honest, i understood why the rta examiners are tough on drivers, in my second attempt there was a guy with me and while he drove, i feared for my own life! and turns out he was attempting through the golden chance and had 15 years of driving experience back at home country. i was grateful for the examiner for failing him, just so that this guy not behind a wheel putting his and others life at risk. and he was extremely angry at the examiner for failing him in his second attempt! my advice is even if you are skilled driver with a lot of experience skip the golden chance. you are evaluated against students who had put in the time to go through the full process and that confidence shows at the exam and examiners use this as baseline to judge everyone. but if you really want to give it go, go for it. maybe youll luck out and pass! my final rta failures attempt 1 silly mistake of not stopping fully when entering the main road. there was no oncoming traffic and there was no stop sign but i should have known better. attempt 2 went above the speed limit by about 10 kmh. again, a silly mistake that could have been avoided. passed in the 3rd attempt. hope this helps someone as i picked up a lot of tips from reddit myself throughout the process. ama!",0.7908244132995605,0.04918869957327843,True

curriculum UAE,abudhabi,https://www.reddit.com/r/abudhabi/comments/18vy3pn/questions_about_studying_in_germany/,,"hello, how long did it take for you to receive your student visa from the time you of your appointment day?",Higher Education,Dubai,"questions about studying in germany hello rabudhabi! i am a student at dit deggendorf, and i completed the american curriculum, including ap exams, before graduating from abu dhabi, uae. transitioning to study in germany was a challenge, from handling documents and certificates to navigating certified language institutes, visa appointments, and setting up a blocked account. i want to share my experiences and offer advice to others facing similar hurdles. here are some key tips that have been invaluable to me 1. learn the language even if your major is taught in english, learn the language. start learning it as early as possible. 2. visa appointments when booking appointments at the german embassy, it is important to align your timing with midnight in germany. currently, theres a two-hour time difference, so bookings typically open at 2 am local time. appointments are available every tuesday and friday, usually a month to 2 months in advance of the current day. keep an eye out for random available dates due to cancellations which can be any day of the week. the system resets at 330 am, but bookings can still be made afterward, but still your chances thin out and become less. if you have tried and cant get an appointment then consider using protonvpn to bypass online queues. additionally, setting up the lighting autofill extension for filling your info so that its instant instead of taking 20 seconds. the only thing you will have to manually type is the recaptcha. 3. book appointments early even if you have not been accepted yet, book appointments as soon as possible they are free. i booked mine two months in advance with incomplete documents but have managed to get everything ready on time. if your appointment is approaching and you are missing required documents, it is best to postpone after you have confirmed your new appointment. note that you can only book 1 appointment per person. this is known by your passport number, so cancel your old appointment and then book your new one right after. if you are worried your papers will not be ready, only cancel your appointment when you have got another one booked. you can only have one appointment at a time because the system knows who you are through your passport. so, keep the cancellation and registration pages open at the same time. when you see the appointment you want and it stops being available, quickly switch to the cancellation page. cancel your old appointment, then jump on the new one right away. 4. studentenwerk dorms apply at least three months before your degrees start date. this can be a challenging process, but starting early helps. if you are looking for universities in bigger cities like munich, berlin, hamburg, and frankfurt then you will have to resort to private accommodation due to the high demand and very little supply in those cities. i found a dorm in deggendorf, which has relatively less demand and is all around cheaper compared to the bigger cities. i have more insights to share, so feel free to ask questions. lets keep the discussion focused on preparing to study in germany, particularly for students from the uae, saudi arabia, qatar, or oman. i am posting because i struggled to find up-to-date information, especially regarding visa appointments for students only issued in dubai for uae residentrs.",0.4474533498287201,0.4539925456047058,True

internship job hunting - personal experience - tips tricks hey rdubai community, nbsp edit 1 as mentioned below, i had a final interview the next day this post was made. happy to say everything went positively and will be starting my new job next week onwards. so in short, it took me 3 months after my previous job worked for 1 year, adopting the below strategy to land a satisfactory job with proper package that justifies my knowledge and experience. was also parallely preparing to learn german a2 level language which i wrote the exam this week and passed. more on that prep here. nbsp hope you all are well. have been thinking of posting this for a long time seeing the frequent posts seeking advice for job hunts, graduate student prospects etc. i felt to hold on until i myself actually go through the entire process and be experienced enough to share genuine and credible knowledge on the matter. now that its going to be almost one year since my graduation, i have quite a bit of information to share with the community that you may find helpful or helps you find peace with the reality and move on. its going to be a lengthy one, hence please bear with me. to the experienced professionals reading this, please feel free to correct me on the below. the graduates students in uae really needs your genuine support. nbsp tldr my experience in job hunting, landing an internship, optimising job search, understanding recruitment culture, future prospects for graduate and students in the uae. no wasta involved. lengthy post, expect 15 minutes to go through the entire thread. nbsp i am structuring this posts as i am creating it, so bear with me if it appears disconnected with the flow in between. also, keep in mind, my advise here would best suit studentsgraduates professionals with less than 2 years of experience.sadly all of them are majorly seen as one group in the uae, regardless of your graduation date, minimum experience is expected nbsp nbsp who am i? i feel i also need to give a short note on myself so that what ever i provide would be credible and realistic to present market and above said category. - i am a mechanical engineering graduate from a khda accredited university in dubai. graduated in december 2020. - have considerable amount of volunteering experiences for various events, conferences. - started researching and hunting for opportunities from my third year onwards. early 2019 - grabbed an internship at a fortune 500 mnc for 2 months, which was later on extended monthly basis 7 months until they couldnt extend it further due to company policy. roles revolved around tendering and sourcing for tunrkey power grids projects. - got a similar role at a small company 7 employees, worked for one year before resigining. nbsp nbsp so to start off, i would like to mention the best primary source tool for job hunting for uae students graduates linkedin keywords. now dont get me wrong, linkedin is the best place to find existing opportunities. when it comes to submitting your application, its a different story. to explain it in better words, i categories jobs found on linkedin in three ways. nbsp nbsp 1 linkedin job section, ones with easy apply the function is simple, you create a standard linkedin profile, upload your resume, answer basic preliminary questions and quick apply. now, since this task is as easy as it sounds, the number of applications sent for such jobs can also seen to be considerable. this is where linkedin filtering comes into play, check if the resume is ats compliant, has all the keywords the recruiter is searching for. keywords usually found in the body of the job post nbsp the recruiter will probably only go through the first 50 resumes that linkedin algorithm would have segregated. you will get notified if the recuiter viewed your application or downloaded your resume. i have not been fortunate enough to go more than this level, hence cant comment further. i had taken linkedin premium subscription for a trial to see what difference it made in my applications. i could see the position of my application compared to the other applicants. even though i was ranked in top 20 30 40 positions, the application did not go beyond just getting a view from the recruiter. furthermore, in the past three years 2019 - 2021, i havnt found relevant postings with in this category for mechanical electrical civil engineerings. primarily its more of commercial communication roles such as digimarketing, hr, admin, finance, software devops. internship grad programs even then, i do go through those posts just to see if there are growth prospects with my degree to become an expert in commercial roles such as sales, busines devops. nbsp 2 linked job section, ones with out easy apply this section is some what a chaotic one. there would be a mix of genuine, fake, outdated, multiple copies, unrealistic, not often but sometimes racist postings. my tip for job hunting in this section is to make use of the filter options and as previously mentioned keyword, as much as possible. i cannot stress the importance of using keywords during job hunting. nbsp slightly going off track to explain keywords in this context with a personal example. the keywords related to my background would be, mechanical, cad, rd, cfd, technical analysis, solidworks etc. as any graduate, you should filter your search using keywords such as graduate, junior, trainee, fresher, graduate program, intern, internship for students, assistant etc.. i myself am experienced in supplychain, hence often use the keywords procurement, global sourcing, tendering, vendor registration, pre-qualification etc... during my job hunt. also make sure to find such keywords relevant to your profile and from the job description to be included in your resume. this plays an eminent role in ranking high while being filtered by ats. coming back to my main point, using keywords to filter job applications. some more tips to filter - filter date posted to either past day, past week, or maximum past month. nothing beyond that is worth sitting to apply for. its highly unlikely the recruiter would be still in search of a candidate even after one month. not saying its impossible, its just highly unlikely. - sort posts by recent rather relevant. this will avoid missing some important job ads that might actually be relevant but for some reason linkedin decided it isnt. - avoid filtering by experience level. some how, uae market has managed by mess up this feature by adding postings with 5 years of experience in entry level careers. what ever they smoke must be a good quality one. no offence, just a random rage while thinking about the silly matter which means its important that you go through majority of the posts to understand prerequisites properly. nbsp so once you filter your search using keywords date posted, you will get a list of proper job ads which will help you narrow down potential job ads relevant to your field. for some reason, linkedin updated their portal to only show ads that fits in 40 pages, and nothing more even though there would be pleanty left. hence usuing multiple relevant keywords will help to avoid missing out on relevant job ads. for a person sitting full-time on job hunting will surely benefit from these tactics. nbsp nbsp now coming to the final part in this section, submitting your application. the job ads will either be 2a linked directly to company website siemens, abb, schneider electric, ge etc 2b linked to 3rd party job boards naukari gulf, gulf talent etc 2c linked to recruitment agency website progressive ge, blackpearl, spark, adecco nbsp nbsp 2a its a good feature of linkedin to comiple all the job ads posted on company website in one place so that a person looking for job can easily spot and go directly to the application portal. post 2020, i have seen most companies migrating to myworkday , while some remain on taleo, oracle, etc.. hence its worth while to keep an account on such company career website, with all the clear details filled, documents uploaded and an updated resume. this makes it easier while applying for multiple roles in the same company. i also used to keep tabs to atleast 10 dream company career websites open and check them every week for potential roles. i am confident to say, from 2019-2021, i have not missed a single internship graduate program opportunity application. submitted all my applications with in one week of the job ads being posted. pre-covid times, i used to get shortlisted for interview, i even landed on an internship. post 2019 with the effect of pandemic things took a major twist. no shortlisting, no progress. regardless, i would still encourage students and graduates to follow this pattern. however, there is an unfortunate realization on such ads companies patterns in hiring people for internship grad programs. will explain in detail later. nbsp nbsp 2b i personally have minimal experience depending on 3rd party job boards. but i acknowledge the fact that there are genuine job ads posted by recruiters hr, who do not own their own career pages have the budget for integrating a career portal. not trying to degrade such companies. they do post promising and relevant jobs. but i have not come across any promising job posts relevant to a student for internships, or a graduate for entry level ops. as mentioned before, even junior level roles have unrealistic expectations. one main advice i would like to provide here is that, if you spot an ad for an mncby seeing the company name, company policy at the end of the job ad, please avoid wasting your time creating and submitting your application on 3rd party website. i highly doubt that the application would genuinely reach the recruiter. its best to always directly apply through career protals. my personal experience is getting a call for internship in 2019 via gulf talent. thats it. not promising either. i hardly dependedinvested time into these websites, so cannot i put more. by early 2021, when linkedin job hunt wasnt showing much progress, i did start using naukarigulf to search for junior, graduate, entry level, fresher rolesdespite having experience. i had also created a profile with my documents all uploaded. i get notifications that certain recruiter from xyz company viewed my profile, downloaded my resume. got three calls so far nbsp 1 relestate company based in india, having a branch in dubai, trying to hire me as a business development executive. despite conveying i was a mechanical engineer and had no interest in the job, the guy was enthusiastic in persuading me to consider the job. i had to end the call abruptly. simple google search on the company returned horrific employee experiences nbsp 2 a digital service solutions porvider who offered 8k aed as a customer service rep to serve german clients. i have a2 level german proficiency despite recieving the highest offer i have recieved post graduation, i had to decline, because i am sure it would only go downhill from there interms of my career progression. nbsp nbsp 2c recruitment agency website internship is nill, graduate roles are pretty much exclusive to locals, junior entry level roles comes once in a bluemoon. i wont dwell lurke much in this area. i have not recieved any calls directly by applying for a job ad from such agency website. however, on registering my profile as an entry level graduate engineer in one such website, i recieved a call from their hq in india, with a promising opportunity according to them to join as a sales executive for a popular online teaching platform for school students, neetjee aspirants ect ... this marks the end of 2nd category. final category is the most promising and more reliable place on linkedin to search for jobs nbsp nbsp 3 linkedin feed this is where you should see relevant posts in terms of new recruitment, company plans, current affairs etc... unfortunately, the platform had been infected with influencer propagandas which leads to a feed filled with reshared motivational posts, story about how a recruiter decided to hire a person with year gap, posts informing that some good is currently recruiting for gcc canad uk and urging applicants to comment interested so that their profile will be genuinely viewed and increase their chances on landing an opportunity. nbsp a good way around spending time scrolling through irrelevant posts is to, again, you keywords. - fresher dubai - internship dubai - junior dubai - entry-level dubai - graduate dubai - 2 year experience dubai - dubai hiring replace dubai with relevant emirate name, but generally dubai has the most number of posts nbsp now, the search results may end up showing same posts over and over again by people who reshared it. as much as i appreciate their gesture in sharing such advertisements, it actually just spams the feed of job seekers with the same job ads. its more than enough for the source to post the job ads and the rest to just comment for visibility. but for some reason, some one have go an extra mile and copy paste the same post for their connections to see, which has now become a social service trend. nbsp hence we have to try to narrow down to the posts as much as possible. unfortunately, linkedin has messed up filtering posts using tools. since the system is spammed with multiple posts, the search result will not be able to properly refine based on filters we add in, which may end up messing up the search mission. for example, we search a keyword and an unlimited number of posts returns as result. filtering the posts which are less than a week old narrows down the posts. now lets say there are 600 posts. if i apply the filter most relevant to most recent the number of posts some how magically comes down to less than a 100 posts. regardless, daily search in this method should provide with some leads promising job opportunities. nbsp nbsp two trypes of people usually posts such job advertisements. 1 company hr, hiring for their own company. when you find such posts, if the said company is relvant to your field of interest, it would be worth while to follow that hr to keep an eye on future relevant posts. usually, they primarily advise to send the resume via email, or connect with them via linkedinrare. sending the application via email should be simple, subject containing job title - name - degree. body custom resume 1 page is preferred followup culture is not appreciated as far as what i have experienced. unless they reach out to you first, with in the first two weeks of sending out the application, you can easily slide off the application as rejected. i still dont know how the hr would sort through all the email applicants for a single role. nbsp personally, i have recieved a couple 4 or 5 feedbacks to discuss further via an interview all in 2021. the good news is, the invites were relevant to my profile, specifically, some in construction industry, one from an automation control manufacturing industry, one for an og industry. the bad news is, none of them valued my previous experience of internships, offered below 3k even though i had mentioned that i had to come from abu dhabi. their justification was that the offer was standard for entry level and there are candidates willing to take it as well. to which i had to politely decline and leave. was it low balling? i am not sure, but i got to know by reaching out to the employees in that company that it is pretty much the conventional practise to restrict the budget to the least amount at that instant. in my case, i was competing with a graduate from my home country who happily accepted the offer. nbsp 2 recruitment consultancies i have had most of my interview invite 10 jobs in 2021 from such consultancies. since i am settled in abu dhabi, my primiary focus was on consultancies who hire for roles based in ad. just searching the keyword hiring abu dhabi gave in a lot of results. more importantly, i avoid wasting time spaming their inboxes, just because it never works. used to do it before i only apply for the jobs were their requirement aligned with my profile ie 2 years of experience. while i was actively looking for a job on a day to day basis, i would scan the results of keywords, find potential job ads, draft an email, a custom resume and schedule the email to be sent at 9 am the following day. this way, i believe so, my emails would have come across the recruiters attention first thing in the morning, at the same time, not so long since the job ad for the role had been released. nbsp nbsp to give a small context on this industry, such recruitment agencies bid for manpower tenders published by their client, usually in bulk, but not always. eitherway, the client allocates some budget for specific roles, the bidder with the best quote and profile gets selected to intake the candidates, take care of the hiring process and visa. in the end making the payroll, visa, and other manpower related liabilities under the recruitment agencies. nbsp nbsp very often, when a recruiter from such agencies post their job ad, they are usually on tendering stage, which means they had not been selected by their client to hire yet. instead they just source for candidates and keep the potential candidate profile on standby. once they recieve the green flag, you would be invited for the final interview. the whole process on an average takes 2 - 4 weeks. generally, they donot reveal the name of the client in the job advert, rather they may mention the industry. nbsp i have experienced only extreme ends in this category. the instance of worst one was when i had scheduled and sent out an application for the following day. i was at work and recieved a call at 9.05 am, and straight out, without any intro, the person asked me if i had my degree to which i replied yes. then he proceeded to ask if i have my valid visa. being confused, i politely asked who was on the call, for all i know, it could be a scammer fooling me to get my personal info. he got angry and told me that he saw my email application and wanted to ask a few questions, and then told me this wont work out and was about to cut the call. it all happened abruptly. i excused him for a moment and asked him if there was any reason, to which he proceeded to ask about my visa situation. i told him i am currently under parents sponsored visa which is valid until so and so, and can be extended for over an year. with out any further questions, he said visa is a problem, you cannot work on that visa, you have to switch to a mission visa, which i tried to negotiate the chance to work while continuing my student visa, but had no avail and ended the call. i opened my email and go to know who had actually contacted me. it was from a well reputed recruitment agency, the person seemed so professional on linkedin and all. i was slightly dumbfounded to see his offline behavior. nbsp another two instances where with two different recruitment agency, recruiting for an abu dhabi governemnt og company, persuading me to join as data entry admin clerk in an offshore island. the job post asked for admin level experience, and stated that the role would be based in an offshore island. i was under the impression that it may as well be a stepping stone to my field of interest, at the same time get an exposure which cannot be attained in any other way. the negative side was that the interviewer belittled me saying that the job description might mention many technical stuff, but they just wanted a person as a clerk. maximum they could compensate was 1500 aed with flight tickets to my home country every alternate 30 days meaning i would only work for 6 months in a year with paid leave. i mentioned that i have no use with thise tickets because my family is settled in the uae. i was trying to negotiate for a higher salary with out the flight ticket compensation and over time. they recruitment agency probably might not have had the budget to extent their offer, which i could understand. but the fact that the professionals had the audacity to call me up and offer 1.5k per month with numerous responsibilities which was all packed under the job title of an offshore clerk, and thought that a revently graduated engineer would be a suitable candidate for the profile slighly numbed my mind. nbsp on the otherhand, not all stories in this section is negative. i have also recieved promising offers from recruiters with a good amount of professionalism as well. again, for the same og client in abu dhabi, who required an sap admin for supply chain dept, i was approached by a recruiter in abu dhabi. the professional handled my application in such a generous way i had not experienced before. infact, it was that person who explained the whole process of tendering and recruiting individuals for their respective clients in the uae. he was very transparent of the process and gave me an overview of the prospects. furthermore, he also mentioned that 2 weeks is the maximum feedback period for such roles, after that, theres very little chance to a progress in the application. i did not get through shortlisting. however, the gentleman recalled my application for another possible role in scm and submitted to his client. the role was retracted later, but i cannot avoid admitting the consideration for my profile. nbsp after august of 2021, i had reached a point where continuing in my current workplace was not promising interms of growth, nor was it anywhere related to my field of interest. since work life was draining mentally, i couldnt muster to power to come back home and apply for alternate jobs. also seeing the job market situation, especially in my case, i decided that i have to take a crucial decision to chase my career growth. i served my notice period and resigned my job to prepare and apply for msc in germany for oct 2022 intake. i had some savings to self finance my education and at the same time will have ample time to find a temporary job before going to germany. nbsp sept - nov, i did not bother thinking about work, rather just passively scrolled through linkedin, this time only searching for keywords such as temporary, part time etc... to support my goal. 2 weeks back, as i was scrolling linkedin in the morning, i came across a job ad that was posted the previous day, for a role in scm, requiring 2 years of experience and needed for only 6 months contract. the candidate had to hold their own visa valid during the contract period. no other information was provided. since i checked all the marks, i sent the application and to my luck, the recruiter called me in the next 10 minutes, confirmed that they are submitting my profile to the client. i enquired about the client industry and was informed that it was a semi government comapny in the utility industry based in abu dhabi. i recieved a secondary interview call from their client, which also went well. attending my final round interview tomorrow. hope things goes well. nbsp it also noteworthy to mention that its best to send in your application to such recruitment consultancies in word format, with a single page. what happens here is that, the recruiter chooses relevant information from your cv, put them on a custom cv template with their company letterhead, and then submit to the client. when the client reached out to me and sent me an online teams meeting invite, she had also input both the proper job description file which was a 3 page pdf i had not seen before, and the custom resume the recruitment agency had submitted. nbsp this pretty much sums up my experience in job hunting and attending interviews as a fresher. before concluding my post, i would like to share a few patterns in recruitments based in uae which i found highly unfair and unethical. unfortunately there isnt much to do about it, regardless i will share it so that some may find peace with it and move on. nbsp nbsp 1 to student graduates of uae, you are no more competing with entry levels graduating from uae alone, but some how, the circle has extended to a global level. i am not talking about cheap labour immigrating into the country. rather i have seen a good amount of western other gcc university students being hired for graduate programs internships in the uae. nbsp as i mentioned earlier, i used to closely follow opportunities in my dream companies, tracking every process, even if my application does not get through, i try to find who got hired, and what i was lacking so i could perfect my skills resume for the next try. how to do this? again, linkedin search. keyword graduate, graduate trainee, early career trainee, intern, trainee and so on. once you find the list of people, its only a matter of filtering by their current company to find the specific person. to my surprise, i found graduates from other gcc countries. now recalling the job postings, the terms did specifically mention that the recruitment was exclusive to uae university graduates. so what happened here? i dont know. furthermore, i did find a company hr posting the photos of their current graduate program trainees from adipec, which were primiarily from outside. nbsp this just degrades the value of studying in the country, paying hefty fees and finally to be persuaded to take a job that pays pennys. not trying to defame uae on this matter, but this bubble is bound to burst somwhere down the lane. ensuring and regulating graduate hirings will only benefit the country positively. infact, i believe it is one of the best source for the government to raise money by bringing in favourable policies laws for uae grads. but as far as my knowledge goes, the educational ministry of uae lack interest in the area, hence the unsatisfactory ranking among the public services. nbsp nbsp 2 there is a clear preference for graduates from certain universities. again a simple linkedin search and statistics would show where the current employees have acquired their degrees from. hands down, i have to say, students of aus have a good upperhand in this game. nbsp to the school students who keep asking for advises on which university to choose, if you can afford the choice, and are just targetting to get into the uae job market, its better to do you research on alumni of colleges in the uae. its 100 x more insightful than seeking advise on reddit on this matter. nbsp nbsp 3 my internship contract did not get extended due to a company policy, which was nothing other than committing to replace me with a local emarati national. the hr was very transparent on the matter. this is inevitable, and we are prone to face this challenge one way or the other until we become skilled enough to become an asset to the company. i just couldnt see myself getting the chance to grow to an expert level, which is why i sought to pursue my msc and grow in germany. nbsp 4 its a frequent advise given to studentsgraduates to gain network, reach out to the hr, make connections etc... but there is a different face to this process as well. the connections we make, the hr we reach out to, need not necessarily be interested in helping out. for instance, i had followed specific graduate programs at a company which was previously an affiliate to the mnc i did my internship with. there was a dedicated field in the application for me to input my company id and line manager details. the graduate program was for the same role as my internship. after submitting the application, i scanned linkedin to find the respective hr manager for the role. to my surprise, i found that the company had a dedicated univerauty recruitment hr, who had shared the news of intaking graduates. i sent a personalized invite and mentioned the details. weeks passby and still no acceptance, on the other hand, her active involvement in linkedin was clearly visible. i felt that approaching through linkedin might have been too informal, and decided to email her with the details. i got the email through one of her old posts. months pass by and i did not receive any feedback. later on the automated rejection email came. trying to recover, i emailed the recruiter seeking advice feedback on my application, to which i got a reply that i did not meet their minimum qualifications. to be better prepared for future postings, i sent a followup email asking for advice on which aspect i was lacking so i could improve it. that was the last correspondence. applied for many other roles and the same role one year later, but was not fortunate enough to even get shortlisted. nbsp 5 as cliché it may sound, theres a timing for everything. fate luck has a good play in this game. unless we have some magical force to manipulate the recruitment culture wasta, we are bound to these aspects. only possible option is to research on whats the best solution for your case in the current situation and work towards that. nbsp nbsp if you have reached this far, i have nothing but hopes for you that this would have enlightened you given you some useful tips in job hunting recruitment culture in the uae for grads. this post might come off scary dissappointing, but thats also one of my intention in making this post. its inevitable, only thing we can do is prepare for it and either plan a sustainable path in advance, change according to circumstances and move on. nbsp nbsp feel free to ask any questions, share any advice, personal experience in the comments. let this thread be a guide for the youth in the community!",0.9436014294624329,0.0019947036635130644,True

unfortunately mdx has not been accredited by the ministry of education moe. which means i will not be able to get moe attestation until they get accredited. i do not even know if they will attest my degree since i got it before mdx was accredited. from what i hear, as of 1st sep 2022, mdx has submitted the paperwork to get accreditation, but no word on when or if they will get it. in other words if you or anyone else you know is going to study at a university in the uae, make sure it is accredited by the moe, if you intend to stay in the country. to add insult to injury, most companies are not going to hire these golden visa graduates. primarily because they will want you to be on their company visa. perhaps they want control over us or maybe they do not trust youngsters, i do not know. however, what i do know is that i am not really wanted here, so i make my leave from here. bonus story this one is not about me, but my friend. my friend was interning at middlesex for about a year something marketing related. after his paid internship got over, he decided to pursue higher studies in canada. now all he requires is a letter of experience. such a simple thing. again. not for mdx. he asked for it but was only ignored. he even messaged his boss, only for her to leave him on read. it took contacting hr to get her to respond, saying she would send the letter the next day. however since at mdx they do not keep their word, it did not come the next day, he had to contact hr again, after which it finally arrived. unfortunately, it only stated he worked 6 months when it should be a lot longer around a year as stated in the contract. my guess is that they did this to exploit some legal loophole, though it is just my guess.",0.6540728211402893,0.10078496485948563,True
